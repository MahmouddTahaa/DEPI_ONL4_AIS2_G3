# DEPI – Microsoft Machine Learning Track

Central repository for the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**  
**Microsoft Machine Learning Track** — supervised by the **Association of Management and Information Technology (AMIT)**

This repository contains all **lecture materials, assignments, and code**
organized by **session**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple learning tracks under the `src/` directory: **CV** (Computer Vision), **DL** (Deep Learning), **DS** (Data Science), **ML** (Machine Learning), **MLOPS** (ML Operations), **NLP** (Natural Language Processing), **python** (Python Fundamentals), etc..

Each track follows the same structure with numbered sessions starting from `session_1`, `session_2`, `session_3`, and so on. Within each session directory (e.g., `src/ML/session_1/`), you'll find three subdirectories:

- **`assignments/`** - Assignment instructions and solutions
- **`code/`** - Code examples, Jupyter notebooks, and demonstrations
- **`materials/`** - Lecture slides, notes, and reading materials

Sessions are numbered sequentially, and additional sessions follow the same pattern (session_4, session_5, etc.).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+** ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Git** ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional, for interactive development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MahmouddTahaa/DEPI_ONL4_AIS2_G3.git
   cd DEPI_ONL4_AIS2_G3
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

### Navigating Sessions

The repository contains multiple tracks (CV, DL, DS, ML, MLOPS, NLP, python), each organized by numbered sessions. Navigate to your desired track under `src/`, then select the session number (e.g., `session_1`, `session_2`). Each session contains three subdirectories: `materials/` for lecture content, `code/` for examples and notebooks, and `assignments/` for assignments and solutions.

### Working with Data

- All shared datasets are stored in the `Data/` directory
- Session-specific data files may be located in respective session folders

### Best Practices

- Follow the session order for structured learning
- Complete assignments before moving to the next session
- Review code examples and experiment with modifications
- Keep your work organized in the appropriate session folders
